Recently, neural networks have grabbed a lot of attention. They are a computing system of interconnected nodes and act similarly to how a brain functions. This system clusters large, raw data sets, and by finding patterns they can then solve very complex problems and classify inputs or even make difficult predictions. The most amazing part? They have the ability to never stop learning!
